# Amazon-Vine Analysis
## Overview of Analysis
We are tasked with analyzing Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies like SellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review.

## Results 
### How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?
There were 94 Vine reviews and 40,471 non-Vine reviews. 

### How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
There were 48 Vine reviews that are 5 stars and 15663 non-Vine reviews that are 5 stars.

### What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
51.06% of Vine reviews were 5 stars. 38.70% of on-Vine reviews were 5 stars. 

## Summary
I believe there is positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program because there was a higher percentage of 5 stars reviews for them versus non-Vine reviews. An additional analysis that could be done is running another set of product reviews through the website or seeing how many other star reviews got a certain percent.
